Advanced Motor Control 
.......................

:Latest release: 1.0.0beta2
:Maintainer: markb
:Description: This repository contains S/W to support Field-Oriented Control (FOC) of motors.


Firmware and documentation to go with the XMOS XK-MC-LVM2 and XP-MC-CTRL-L2 Motor Control Development Kits.

Key Features
============

   * Dual Axis Field Oriented Control (Speed Control) of PMSM Motors
   * Dual Axis Trapezoidal Commutation (Speed Control) of BLDC Motors
   * Up to 142kHz inner loop performance
   * Complementary PWM up to 48 KHz at 11-bit complementary PWM resolution  
   * CAN or Ethernet interface with LabView GUI, or use push-button control
   * Component based approach to motor drive and communications interfaces

Firmware Overview
=================

The software is split into modules and applicatons, as describes below:
